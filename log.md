# 100 Days of Code

I haven't written much code lately, so I'm joining my friend [Tommy](https://github.com/tommycollison/100_days_of_code/) (currently doing [Lambda School's CS program](http://go.lambdaschool.com/)) for [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)!

## In Brief

| D1 | Started learning Swift / building a pedometer app in Xcode |

## Log

#### D1 8/9
- New computer; downloaded Xcode, Git, Sublime, etc.
- Skimmed the Swift documentation and was like "boom, I got this!"
- Created a new project in Xcode and was immediately freaked out by the architecture
- Started following [this pedometer tutorial](https://makeapppie.com/2017/02/14/introducing-core-motion-make-a-pedometer/).
